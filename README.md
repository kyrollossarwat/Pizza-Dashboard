This project involved analyzing key business metrics like total revenue, order quantity, and pizza category performance. 
I built interactive visualizations that provided insights into:

🍕 Top 5 and bottom 5 pizzas by order quantity
📅 Order trends by weekday, hour, and month
🍽️ Pizza categories and sizes, and their total prices
